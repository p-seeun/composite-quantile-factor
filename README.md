# composite-quantile-factor
The source code for simulations and real data analysis included in the paper 'Composite Quantile Factor Modeling for High-Dimensional Data' is available. For the real data analysis, two economic datasets are used: the CRSP monthly stock return data and the FRED-MD data.

## Overview
- `CQFM algorithm.R` is a code for functions that estimate composite quantile factor model. 
- `RobPCA, QFM algorithms.R` is a code that implements algorithms of robust PCA proposed by He et al.(2022) and quantile factor model proposed by Chen et al.(2021).
- Simulations
  - This folder includes codes that derive the results in Tables 1 and 2.  
- Real data analysis
  - Monthly stock return : 
  - FRED-MD :
